**SCBehavior-Dataset** comprises 1,346 high-resolution images of classroom scenes, each with varying distributions of student behaviors.We encompasses seven different types of student behaviors
: read, write, lookup, raise_hand, turn_head, stand, and discuss. These categories essentially cover the typical behaviors observed in daily classroom activities. 
The diverse distribution of these behaviors across different scenes enhances the datasetâ€™s robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios.

_We also provide the dataset in both YOLO and COCO formats for the convenience of other researchers._
